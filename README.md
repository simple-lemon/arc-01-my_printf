# Welcome to My Printf
*my_printf.c*

## Task
The my_printf() function produce output according to a format as described below. The my_printf() functions write output to stdout, the standard output stream;

## Description
This function writes the output under the control of a format string that specifies how subsequent arguments (or arguments accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of stdarg(3)) are converted for output.

## Installation
The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not PERCENT), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.

## Usage

Each conversion specification is introduced by the PERCENT character. The arguments must correspond properly (after type promotion) with the conversion specifier. After the PERCENT, the following appear in sequence:


./my_project argument1 argument2

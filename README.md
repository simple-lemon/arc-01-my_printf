## my_printf
The my_printf function is a custom implementation of the printf function in C. It provides a way to format and print text to the standard output. It supports various format specifiers, such as %s for strings, %d for integers, %c for characters, %u for unsigned integers, %o for octal numbers, %x for hexadecimal numbers, and %p for memory addresses.

## Description
This code demonstrates a custom implementation of the printf function in C. It includes helper functions that handle different format specifiers and perform the necessary conversions to print the corresponding values. The code uses recursion to handle conversions for integers, octal numbers, and hexadecimal numbers. It also handles the special case of null strings.

## Task
The task of this code is to provide a simplified version of the printf function that can be used to format and print text to the standard output. It demonstrates how format specifiers can be processed and how different types of values can be converted and printed.

## Usage
To use the my_printf function, include the code in your project and call it with a format string and the corresponding arguments. The format string should contain the desired format specifiers to format the values. For example:
my_printf("Hello, %s!\n", "world");
my_printf("The answer is %d.\n", 42);
my_printf("Octal value: %o\n", 123);
my_printf("Unsigned decimal: %u\n", 12345);
my_printf("Hexadecimal: %x\n", 255);
my_printf("Address: %p\n", (void*) main);
my_printf("Character: %c\n", 'A');
my_printf("Null string: %s\n", NULL);
my_printf("%X!\n", 14);

## Installation
To use this code, you can simply copy the code and include it in your project. Make sure to include the necessary header files (stdio.h, unistd.h, stdarg.h) as well. Then, you can call the my_printf function with the desired format string and arguments to print formatted text to the standard output.

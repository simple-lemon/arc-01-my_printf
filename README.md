# Secret Code Game

## Overview

This is a command-line game written in C where the player's goal is to guess a secret 4-digit code. The code is either randomly generated by the program or provided by the user through command-line arguments. The digits in the code are unique and range from 0 to 8.

## How to Play

1. Run the program. A secret 4-digit code will be generated.
2. You will be prompted to enter your guess.
3. After each guess, the program will give you two pieces of information:
   - The number of digits that are correct and in the correct position (Well placed pieces)
   - The number of digits that are correct but in the wrong position (Misplaced pieces)
4. Use this information to guess the secret code.

## How to Stop the Game

The game can be stopped in three ways:

1. **Guessing the Code Correctly**: If you guess the secret code correctly, the game will stop and display a congratulatory message.
2. **Exhausting All Attempts**: The game will also stop if you have used up all your attempts without guessing the code correctly.
3. **Manual Interruption**: You can manually stop the game at any time by sending an interrupt signal. On most systems, this can be done by pressing `Ctrl+C` or `Ctrl+D` in the terminal where the game is running. This will immediately terminate the game. Please note that unsaved progress will be lost.

## Rules

- Each digit in the secret code and your guess must be between 0 and 8.
- No two digits in the secret code or your guess can be the same.
- Your guess must be exactly 4 digits long.

## Command Line Arguments

The game accepts two optional command-line arguments:
- `-c <code>`: Provide a custom secret code for the game.
- `-t <attempts>`: Set a custom number of attempts for the game.

## Code Breakdown

- `generate_code()`: Generates a random 4-digit code.
- `is_valid_input(char *guess)`: Checks if the player's guess is valid.
- `getin()`: Reads the player's guess from the standard input.
- `check_guess(char *code, char *guess, int *well_placed, int *misplaced)`: Checks the player's guess against the secret code.
- `arguments(int argc, char *argv[], char **code, int *attempts)`: Processes the command-line arguments.
- `main(int argc, char *argv[])`: The main function of the program.

## Example

```bash
./game -c 1234 -t 5

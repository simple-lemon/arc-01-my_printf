# my_printf

## Description

The `my_printf` function is a custom implementation of the printf function in C, allowing formatted output to the standard output stream. It supports formatting specifiers for strings, integers, characters, unsigned integers, octal, hexadecimal, and pointers.

## Task

The primary goal of `my_printf` is to provide a flexible and lightweight alternative to the standard printf function in C. It supports a subset of format specifiers commonly used in printf, allowing users to format and print various types of data.

## Installation and Usage

To use `my_printf`, include the provided source code in your project. The code relies on standard C libraries and should work in most C environments. To use the function, call `my_printf` with a format string and additional arguments corresponding to the format specifiers used in the string.

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Printing Strings


```my_printf("Hello, %s!\n", "world");```
// Output: Hello, world!
 

### Example 2: Printing Integers


```my_printf("The answer is %d.\n", 42);```
// Output: The answer is 42.` 

### Example 3: Printing Hexadecimal
```my_printf("Hexadecimal: %x\n", 255);```
// Output: Hexadecimal: ff` 

### Example 4: Printing Pointers

```
int value = 123;
my_printf("Address of value: %p\n", (void*)&value);
```
// Output: Address of value: 0x7ffe12345678 (example address)`

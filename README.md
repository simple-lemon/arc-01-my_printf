# Description

The `my_printf` function is a custom implementation of the printf function in C, providing formatted output to the standard output stream. This implementation supports a subset of format specifiers commonly used in printf, allowing users to format and print various types of data, including strings, integers, characters, unsigned integers, octal, hexadecimal, and pointers.

# Task

The primary goal of `my_printf` is to offer a flexible and lightweight alternative to the standard printf function in C. It is designed to be simple to use while supporting essential formatting options.

# Installation and Usage

To use `my_printf`, include the provided source code in your project. The code relies on standard C libraries and should work in most C environments. To use the function, call `my_printf` with a format string and additional arguments corresponding to the format specifiers used in the string.

# Example Usage

# Example 1: Printing Strings

```c
my_printf("Hello, %s!\n", "world");
// Output: Hello, world!
```

# Example 2: Printing Integers
```c
my_printf("The answer is %d.\n", 42);
// Output: The answer is 42.
```

# Example 3: Printing Hexadecimal
```c
my_printf("Hexadecimal: %x\n", 255);
// Output: Hexadecimal: ff
```

# Example 4: Printing Pointers
```c
int value = 123;
my_printf("Address of value: %p\n", (void*)&value);
// Output: Address of value: 0x7ffe12345678 (example address)
```

# Format Specifiers Supported
 - %c: Character
 - %d: Decimal (integer)
 - %s: String
 - %o: Octal
 - %x: Hexadecimal
 - %p: Pointer
 - %u: Unsigned Integer

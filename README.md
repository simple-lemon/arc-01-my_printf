# Description

The my_printf function produces output according to a specified format. It writes output to stdout, the standard output stream. The function is designed to emulate the behavior of the standard printf function, providing a simplified implementation of its core features.

# Task

The task is to implement the my_printf function, which accepts a format string and variable arguments, printing the formatted output to the standard output stream. The format string can contain directives for formatting different types, such as %d, %s, %c, %o, %u, %x, and %p.

# Usage

%d dan foydalanish:
my_printf("%d\n", 12345678);

%s dan foydalanish:
my_printf("\%s\n", str);

%c dan foydalanish:
my_printf("%c\n", c);

%o dan foydalanish:
my_printf("%o\n", num);

%u dan foydalanish:
my_printf("%u\n", num);

%x dan foydalanish:
my_printf("%x\n", num);

%p dan foydalanish:
my_printf("%p\n", &num);

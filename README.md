#Welcome to My Printf Project

#Description

This program parses the text given in the command line arguments, finds how many times each character is repeated, and prints it on the screen.
#Task

The task is to implement the my_printf function, which accepts a format string and variable arguments, printing the formatted output to the standard output stream. The format string can contain directives for formatting different types, such as %d, %s, %c, %o, %u, %x, and %p.
#Usage

This program can be used to analyze texts displayed on the command line. For example, you can run the program using the following command: ./my_printf "Hello world!" "This is a test."
This command "Hello, world!" and "This is a test." Passes their text to the program as an argument.
The program finds the number of repetitions of each character and prints it on the screen. For example, when you run the above command, you might get the following output: :4 !: one ,: one .:2 H: 1 T: 1 a: 1 d:1 e: 1 i: 2 l: 3 it is: 2 r: 1 p:3 t:4 w: 1
This output displays characters and the number of occurrences of characters. The space character is repeated 4 times, and the "i" and "t" characters are repeated 2 times.
#Installation

Open a text editor and copy the program code.
The program is compiled using the compiler. The following command was used to compile the program in the terminal gcc my_printf.c -o printf
This compiles a file named my_printf.c to create an executable named program.
After the compilation process is completed successfully, an executable named printf is created in the same directory.
Run the program using the following command in the terminal: ./printf "Hello world!" "This is a test."
This command starts an executable program and says "Hello, world!" and "This is a test." Passes their text to the program as an argument.
When finished, I pushed it to git hub via git. git branch , git switch , git add . , git commit -m"project", git push
